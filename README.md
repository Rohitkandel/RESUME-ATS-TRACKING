RESUME-ATS-TRACKING

This repository implements a prototype Applicant Tracking System (ATS) analyzer using a pre-trained AI model (currently a placeholder). It aims to assist users in optimizing their resumes for specific job descriptions.

Key Functionalities (Current Stage):

PDF Text Extraction: Extracts text from uploaded PDF resumes using a reliable library like PyPDF2.
Placeholder Analysis (Future Implementation): Placeholder functionality to demonstrate the future analysis pipeline. You'll replace this with your actual implementation (e.g., keyword extraction, matching with job descriptions, and resume scoring).
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling to provide informative messages to users for missing uploads or file processing issues.
Technology Stack:

Python: The core programming language.
Streamlit: A Python library for building interactive web apps.
PyPDF2: A library for handling and extracting text from PDF documents.
dotenv: A library for securely managing environment variables (optional, consider using secrets management in production).
Instructions

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Streamlit (https://streamlit.io/)
PyPDF2 (install using pip install PyPDF2)
dotenv (optional, install using pip install python-dotenv)
Installation:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/RohitKandel/RESUME-ATS-TRACKING.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd RESUME-ATS-TRACKING
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (create a requirements.txt file listing all necessary libraries)
Configuration (Optional):

Create a .env file to store environment variables (e.g., API keys). Exclude this file from version control (add it to your .gitignore).
Run the App:

Start a terminal in the project directory and run: streamlit run app.py
Open http://localhost:8501/ in your web browser.
Future Development:

Integrate an actual AI model for resume analysis (consider exploring publicly available pre-trained models or training your own).
Implement keyword extraction and matching between resumes and job descriptions.
Provide resume scoring based on the analysis.
Offer tailored suggestions for improving resume content and structure.
Enhance user interface and experience.
Disclaimer:

This project is currently under development and uses a placeholder analysis function. The provided instructions and functionalities serve as a starting point for building a more complete ATS analyzer.
